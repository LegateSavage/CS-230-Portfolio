SNHU, CS-230 - Operating Platforms

Assignment 8-2
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is a software company named The Gaming Room. They were wishing to design a game named Draw It or Lose It that already functioned and was successful on android operating systems. The Gaming Room wishes to continue on the success of the game, and expand their market to a web-based platform. The requirements that they requested include creating a functioning software on several other platforms such as, Mac, Linux, Windows, and iOS smartphone devices. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel as though there were several things I could improve on when it comes to programming in Java. Java has proven to be on of the most difficult languages for me to learn. I feel as though I did the overall analysis on the software requirements and understanding the clients requirments better than I did the actual work on Java. I think given a few more instances of practice I will learn Java really well like I did C++ and pyhton.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I enjoyed using a design document as it helped me to better understand everything that goes into the code of a project. It functioned as a plan before delving into the code itself.

f you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

 I would choose to revise what I had done in Project 2. It was a rushed week for me when writing that part of the design template and there where a few factors in regards to different operating systems that I relize I left out that I would implment into the design in order to improve the overall quality of the project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I used the design template and careful understanding of the clients requirements in order to interpret the user's needs. This effect the software design because the user's needs is always considered when desgining software to make the program user friendly, easy to use, and easy to understand. Each user wants to be able to use the program with no issues which is why it is always important to consider their needs when desigining software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
i approached designing the software with patience. There were several times where I found myself lost because I was trying to do to much in a little time. Taking a step away from the project and clearing my mind helped me come back to the program and see mistakes i would have otherwise missed. I plan on continuing this stategy venturing on in my programming classes.
